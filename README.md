I made this project as part of an evaluation for the position of Java Software Engineer at Crossover.

You can check assignment.md for the assignment description and navigate through the commit history to see the project as it was delivered to me and what changes I made.

I could've added a few improvements but I had three days to deliver it and I wanted to keep it simple and straight to the point. The project was approved.

Things that can be added:

- More tests (I focused on good code coverage, but it's missing a lot of unit testing.)
- Better logs and HTTP response codes.
- Dependency Injection.
- Behavioral Driven tests.
- Add a mvn execution that runs the application in a docker container from the image that they mention.

A lot of other improvements could've been made to the design of the application, but that would've broke the rules of the assignment.
